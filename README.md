<h3>Scenario D: Resolving Email Synchronization Issues</h3>

User: Amos Burton

Background:

Amos Burton, a sales executive, submits a ticket via osTicket, reporting that his email is not synchronizing properly across his devices. As the IT help desk agent, your goal is to troubleshoot and resolve the synchronization issue to ensure seamless access to his emails across all platforms.

![amos b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd1f00d9-3f45-4f76-92d0-fb60b132a2ec)

<h3>Approach to Resolution:</h3>

Initial Assessment:

- <b>Initiate a detailed conversation with Amos through osTicket, asking for specifics about the devices he uses, the email client or service, and any error messages he has encountered.</b>
- <b>Determine if the issue started after a particular update or change in settings.</b>
- <b>Establish a remote desktop connection to further diagnose the problem.</b>

![amos1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5261cc7c-9915-486c-8c66-d37a86747ff5)

<h3>Specific Problem Identified:</h3>

During the remote diagnosis, it's discovered that Amos's smartphone and tablet are not set to use IMAP for his email account, which is essential for synchronizing emails across multiple devices. Instead, they are configured with POP3, leading to emails being downloaded to a single device and not being accessible on others.

<h3>Resolution Steps:</h3>

- <b>Change the email settings from POP3 to IMAP on both his smartphone and tablet.</b>
- <b>Ensure that Amos's laptop is also configured to use IMAP for his email account, ensuring consistency across all devices.</b>

![popimap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16cfac9f-fe7a-4e8d-8d6d-130123bd5c9c)

Test email synchronization by instructing Amos to send a test email to himself and check if it appears across all his devices.

Documentation & Closure:

- <b>Document all steps taken to resolve Amos's email synchronization issue within osTicket, including the initial problem identification, communication logs, and the resolution process.</b>
- <b>Close the ticket within osTicket once Amos confirms the issue is resolved to his satisfaction, ensuring a record of the solution is available for future reference.</b>

<h3>Scenario E: Addressing Printer Connectivity Problems</h3>

User: Anderson Dawes

Background:

Anderson Dawes, an account manager, submits a ticket through osTicket, indicating that he cannot connect to the network printer from his laptop. The printer is essential for his role, as he frequently needs to print contracts and reports for clients. As the IT help desk agent, your task is to diagnose and rectify the connectivity problem to restore Anderson's printing capabilities.

![anderson d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6459c6cf-09fa-4c70-89ad-edd6db6d1c03)

<h3>Approach to Resolution:</h3>

Initial Assessment:

- <b>Communicate with Anderson and ask further questions about the problem.</b>
- <b>Establish a remote desktop connection to Andersonâ€™s workstation to further diagnose the issue.</b>

![anderson2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/244ee7e1-8747-4859-b8a6-f01139ed3313)

<h3>Specific Problem Identified:</h3>

The primary issue hindering Anderson Dawes from connecting to the network printer is an incorrect printer IP address configuration on his laptop. After the recent network upgrade, the IP addresses of several devices, including printers, were changed to accommodate the new networking schema. However, Anderson's laptop retained the old IP address for the printer, leading to failed connection attempts. This misconfiguration is a common oversight following network modifications, especially if devices are manually configured or if the update communication does not reach all users effectively.

<h3>Resolution Steps:</h3>

- <b>Update Printer IP Address on Anderson's Laptop</b>
- <b>This can be done by accessing the printer properties via the Control Panel (or Settings app in Windows 11) and updating the port configuration under the 'Ports' tab to the new IP address. This can be done by accessing the printer properties via the Control Panel (or Settings app in Windows 11) and updating the port configuration under the 'Ports' tab to the new IP address.</b>

![printerport](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/922a5e91-a30b-4d27-b7f1-075923515e3d)

Verify connectivity by attempting to print a test page.

Documentation & Closure:

- <b>Document the steps taken to resolve the issue within osTicket Additionally, update any internal IT documentation to reflect the new network configuration and troubleshooting steps for related issues.</b>
- <b>Close the ticket once Anderson confirms the issue is resolved.</b>
